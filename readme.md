# Blazor Custom Elements Sample

The purpose of this repository is to show **Blazor Custom Elements** in action
alongside ASP.NET Core Razor Pages. 

https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/asp-net-core-updates-in-dotnet-7-preview-6/#blazor-custom-elements-no-longer-experimental

1. The host is ASP.NET Core
2. The host framework is Razor Pages
3. The component framework is Blazor Web Assembly.

The purpose of custom elements is to allow you to build small islands of functionality without having to go **ALL IN** on blazor. You can write self-contained components that you can place anywhere on an HTML-output page (Razor Pages, MVC view, regular HTML).

## Prerequisites

- .NET 7 Preview 6+

## Debugging

If you'd like to debug your components, the infrastructure is set up for that. If you're a [JetBrains Rider](https://jetbrains.com/rider) user, you need to enable `with JavaScript Debugger` in your run configuration.
